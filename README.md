# Installation
```
cargo install analog-clock
```

# Usage
See `--help`.

# Note
1. You have to zoom out your terminal emulator have better rendering quality, however zooming out too much will affect performance.  
2. The aspect ratio of the clock is determined by the aspect ratio of the terminal window. If the window is squar-ish, then the clock will be circle-ish; if the window is rectangular, then the clock will be an ellipse.
